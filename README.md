# test8085
Tests for various components of the 8085 computer

These are quick and dirty tests I made at some point to troubleshoot various components of my 8085 computer.  
I didn't clean anything, I'm just putting them there in case I need them again someday.

- testBank / testBR: Related to bank register and banking logic
- testFT240: USB interface with FT240 
- testIO: IO functions: beep, keyboard buffer
- testPIT: Focus on the PIT (interval timer)
- testROM: Sanity check, just outputs values on ports in a loop
