# ASxxxx Cross Assemblers
I'm using unmodified versions of the `as8085.exe` assembler and the `aslink.exe` linker in this project

>The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assemblers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
>contains  cross  assemblers  for the 1802, S2650, SC/MP, MPS430, 6100, 61860,  6500,  6800(6802/6808),  6801(6803/HD6303),  6804,
>6805,  68HC(S)08,  6809,  68HC11, 68HC(S)12, 68HC16, 740, 78K/0, 78K/0S,  8008,  8008S,  8048(8041/8022/8021)  8051,  8085(8080),
>8X300(8X305),   DS8XCXXX,   AVR,   EZ80,   F2MC8L/FX,   F8/3870, GameBoy(Z80), H8/3xx, Cypress PSoC(M8C), PIC, Rabbit  2000/3000,
>ST6,  ST7,  ST8,  Z8, Z80(HD64180), and Z280 series microprocessors.  Each  assembler  has  a  device  specific  section  which
>includes:   (1)  device description, byte order, and file extension information, (2) a table of assembler  general  directives,
>special directives, assembler mnemonics and associated operation codes, (3) machine  specific  code  for  processing  the  device
>mnemonics, addressing modes, and special directives.
